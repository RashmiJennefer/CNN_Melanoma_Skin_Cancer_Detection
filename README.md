## Problem Statement
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Model Overview
- Model 1 : Basic Model
- Model 2 : Manual Augmentation
- Model 3 : Automatic Augmentation
 
## Conclusions
Overfitting eliminated to reach a decent accuracy by using:
- Data augmentation
- Managing Class imbalance
- Using Dropout Layers

The final model gave Train accuracy of 0.8865 and Validation accuracy of 0.8456
